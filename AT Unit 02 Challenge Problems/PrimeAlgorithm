SW design with Java 
Jonathan Martinez 

This is a written Algorithm to determine whether a integer is prime 


First - Collect a positive input from the user. Anything less than or equal to 1 is useless. 
Any number that is greater than two AND even can also be disregared, since every even number can be divisible by 2.

if userNumber = 2 -> return true 

Second - Start a loop that begins at i = 3 and ends at userNumber, and that moves in incriments of two. 

Third - For each incriment. check if userNumber % i == 0.  If userNumber % i = 0, then return false, since the number is divisable by something other than 1 and itself. Else if userNumber % i != 0 by the time i has reached the value of userNumber, then return True. 

Fourth - Add input validation to make sure strings don't crash code
