Part B:
What is the output of the following code and why?

    public static int getInt() {
        try {
            return 1;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            return 2;
        } finally {
            return 3;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(getInt());
    }



/*
 * The output of the following code would be: 
 * 
 * 3
 * 
 * This is because the method returns 1 in the first, doesn't catch an exception, however is forced to run the finally task and 
 * return the number 3. 
 * 
 * 
 *
