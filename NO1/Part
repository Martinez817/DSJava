Assignment:
Part A:
Laurie launches an email app on her smartphone. She uses it to check her work email. The steps involved are as follows:
1. The email app establishes a connection to the email server 
2. Laurie’s login credentials are authenticated by the server.
3. For receiving emails, the app sends a request to the server, which then retrieves and downloads new messages.
4. For sending emails, the app formats the message and sends it to the server, which then forwards it to the recipient's email server.
5. The app updates the user interface to display the latest email status.

At some point, all the packages go through that ip-conversion thing too. 

Part B:
Jerry decides to play an online first-person shooter game with some friends. The steps involved are as follows:
1. The game application establishes a connection to the game server
2. Jerry logs in, and his credentials are authenticated by the server.
3. The game client sends Jerry’s actions (e.g., movement, shooting) to the server in real-time.
4. The server processes the data and updates the game state for all players.
5. The server sends updates back to Jerry’s game client, which renders the changes on his screen.
6. This process repeats continuously to ensure smooth gameplay.
